# week-1-challenge


# This aim of this project was to change the code so that it follows accessibilty standards and to optimise it for search engines. 
# This was done by changing out some of the previous elements with semantic elements and by adding alt attributes to the img elements. We also added a title which helps with search engine optimisation.
